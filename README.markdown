### Projekt Phoenix
At ikusei we often complete the same steps to get a rails project going. It's always the same tedious apache configuration, setting up local and remote git repositories and editing all template files.
This can take up to an hour, for a task that's not really much fun.  

Since even our non-technical employees (read: project-managers and non-coders) may set up a project and everyone uses Macs here anyway, we created this little Cocoa app.
