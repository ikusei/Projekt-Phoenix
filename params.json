{"name":"Projekt-phoenix","body":"### Projekt Phoenix\r\nAt ikusei we often complete the same steps to get a rails project going. It's always the same tedious apache configuration, setting up local and remote git repositories and editing all template files.\r\nThis can take up to an hour, for a task that's not really much fun.  \r\n\r\nSince even our non-technical employees (read: project-managers and non-coders) may set up a project and everyone uses Macs here anyway, we created this little Cocoa app.  \r\n\r\nIt's based on work done by [Matt Gallagher](http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/11/cocoa-application-for-running-scripts.html).
